  ## Ralph, the ultimate toolbox for your learning analytics - ESupDays \#34

  Ralph is an open source project developed by France UniversitÃ© NumÃ©rique. It
  has been designed as a CLI (and a LRS server) to handle data streams with
  learning analytics in mind.

  This python-powered tool has been designed to build data workflows as UNIX
  pipelines with the KISS (Keep It Small and Simple) mantra as a credo: each
  sub-command achieves a simple task and their combination with other command
  line tools (_e.g._ `ag`, `jq`, `xargs`, ...) performs complex treatments.

  During this talk, we will introduce Ralph features and its possible
  integration in an infrastructure used to collect, transform and store
  learning traces.
